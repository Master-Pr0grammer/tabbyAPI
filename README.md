A FastAPI based application that allows for generating text using an LLM (large language model) using the [Exllamav2 backend](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2)

## Disclaimer

This project is marked rolling release. There may be bugs and changes down the line. Please be aware that you might need to reinstall dependencies if needed.

TabbyAPI is a hobby project solely for a small amount of users. It is not meant to run on production servers. For that, please look at other backends that support those workloads.

## Supported Model Types

TabbyAPI uses Exllamav2 as a powerful and fast backend for model inference, loading, etc. Therefore, the following types of models are supported:

- Exl2 (Highly recommended)

- GPTQ

- FP16 (using Exllamav2's loader)

#### Alternative Loaders/Backends

If you want to use a different model type or quantization method than the ones listed above, here are some alternative backends with their own APIs:

- GGUF + GGML - [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/lostruins/KoboldCPP)

- Production ready + Many other quants + batching [Aphrodite Engine](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/Aphrodite-engine)

- Production ready + batching [VLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
